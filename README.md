# Vaccination-Impact

### Description

***
As our lives have been impacted by the global pandemic that began in 2020, we thought that there couldn't
have been a better data to analyze and put into pratice the skills we have learned in our Database Management class (CS 435) during the semester of Spring '21 at Hunter College.
We used the data from [Our World In Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data) as well as performing the normalization steps required to make our data represanttions more effective and useful using Pandas and Numpy.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
- Backend: Python (Flask), SQLite (previously used: AWS MySQL)
- Data Analysis Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Plotly
- AWS Lambda previously used to auto scrape data from source, normalize data, and update the database daily.
